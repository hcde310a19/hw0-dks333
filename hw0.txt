# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

The previous exercise was fairly easy. Writing instructions in English is explicitly difficult because of my weak
technical writing skills. What was satisfying about writing instructions was that I was able to have a strong
understanding of what this program was designed for. One thing I want to get out from this course is to be able to
create data visualization.
